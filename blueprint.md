## Project Overview

This project aims to create a web application that analyzes a user's facial photo to determine their personal color. The application will have a simple and intuitive interface where users can upload their photo and receive a personal color diagnosis.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Setup:**
    *   Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`).
    *   "Hello World" placeholder content.

## Current Task: Personal Color Analyzer

*   **Objective:** Implement the core functionality of the personal color analyzer.
*   **Plan:**
    1.  **Update HTML (`index.html`):**
        *   Change the title to "나의 퍼스널 컬러는?".
        *   Add a file input element for users to upload their photos.
        *   Add a button to trigger the analysis.
        *   Create a designated area to display the analysis result.
    2.  **Update CSS (`style.css`):**
        *   Apply a clean and modern design.
        *   Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop.
        *   Style the file input, button, and result area for a user-friendly experience.
    3.  **Update JavaScript (`main.js`):**
        *   Implement the logic to handle image uploads.
        *   Create a function to simulate the personal color analysis (initially, it will return a random result).
        *   Display the result dynamically on the page.
