## Project Overview

This project is a "Personal Color Analysis" web application. It allows users to upload a photo of themselves to get a personal color diagnosis (e.g., Spring Warm, Summer Cool) and a recommended color palette. The application features a modern, clean, and intuitive user interface with a purple color scheme.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Setup:**
    *   Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`).
*   **Image Upload and Preview:**
    *   Users can upload an image via a drag-and-drop area or by browsing their files.
    *   A preview of the uploaded image is displayed.
*   **Personal Color Analysis:**
    *   An "Analyze" button triggers the analysis of the uploaded image.
    *   The application determines the user's personal color season (e.g., Spring Warm, Summer Cool).
*   **Result Display:**
    *   The diagnosed personal color season is displayed to the user.
    *   A color palette corresponding to the diagnosed season is shown.
*   **Reset Functionality:**
    *   A "Reset" button allows the user to clear the uploaded image and analysis results to start over.
*   **UI/UX:**
    *   Modern and clean UI with a purple color scheme.
    *   Responsive design for a good experience on different screen sizes.
    *   An illustration is displayed on the main screen.

## Current Task: Add a Favicon

*   **Objective:** Add a favicon to the application to improve brand identity and user experience.
*   **Plan:**
    1.  **Select an Icon:** Choose an appropriate icon that represents the "Personal Color Analysis" theme.
    2.  **Add Favicon to HTML:** Add a `<link>` tag to the `<head>` section of `index.html` to specify the favicon.
